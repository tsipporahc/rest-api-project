Treehouse Techdegree Unit 9 Project

REST API using Express, Node.js, and Sequelize

**Purpose:**
I created this REST API to connect to a school database containing information about users and courses. Users of this API can create new users, update user infomation, create new courses, retrieve infomation on courses, and update or delete existing courses. Users must log in order to access certain endpoints including; user information, creatign new courses and update or delete courses.

**Challenges:**
My challenges included the user authorization and working through the middleare function.
